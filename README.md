# Solid + Vite

Some CSS experiments made with [Solid](https://solidjs.com) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) by Matt Bryant:

- CMYK
- RGB
- XYZ

## Development

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# run locally ( http://127.0.0.1:3000 )
$ npm run dev
```

## Production

```bash
# build for production
$ npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

This project is designed to be deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages).
